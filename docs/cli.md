# Flux Command-Line Interface (CLI) Reference

Flux provides a simple and powerful command-line interface for running
programs, inspecting internal structures, and interacting with the
language in real time.

This document describes all available CLI commands and their usage.

---

## General Usage

```bash
flux <command> <file>
# On Windows (PowerShell):
.\flux <command> <file>
```
Some commands do not require a file argument.

---

## run — Execute a Flux Program
Runs a Flux source file normally.

```bash
flux run program.flux
```
Behavior:

- Executes the program from top to bottom
- Prints output generated by print statements
- Terminates when execution completes or exit is encountered

---

## ast — Print Abstract Syntax Tree
Displays the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of a Flux program.

```bash
flux ast program.flux
```
Purpose:

- Visualize program structure
- Understand how source code is parsed
- Useful for learning and debugging

---

## trace — Execution Trace Mode
Runs a program while printing interpreter-level execution details.

```bash
flux trace program.flux
```
Output includes:

- Variable assignments
- Expression evaluations
- Loop entry and exit
- Conditional decisions

Example trace output:

```
[TRACE] Assign x = 10
[TRACE] Evaluate x > 5 → true
```

---

## env — Runtime Environment Dump
Executes the program and prints the final runtime environment.

```bash
flux env program.flux
```
Displays:

- All variables
- Their final values after execution

Useful for inspecting program state without modifying code.

---

## repl — Interactive REPL Mode
Starts the Flux Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL).

```bash
flux repl
```
Features:

- Execute Flux statements interactively
- Variables persist across commands
- Ideal for experimentation and learning

Example:

```
> x = 10
> print x
10
> exit
```

---

## Error Handling

- Syntax errors are reported during parsing
- Runtime errors are printed with clear, beginner-friendly messages
- `exit` terminates execution cleanly without stack traces

---

## Summary

The Flux CLI is designed to expose both execution and internal language
behavior. Commands like `ast`, `trace`, and `env` make Flux especially
useful as a learning tool for understanding interpreter internals.
